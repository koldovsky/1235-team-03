/*Convert a string to an array
Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words.
Examples (Input ==> Output):
"Robin Singh" ==> ["Robin", "Singh"]
"I love arrays they are my favorite" ==> ["I", "love", "arrays", "they", "are", "my", "favorite"]

/*DNA to RNA Conversion
  Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems.
  It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').
  Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells.
  RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine.
  In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').
  Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.
  For example:
  "GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
  The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty.
  All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.

/*Find Maximum and Minimum Values of a List
  Your task is to make two functions ( max and min, or maximum and minimum, etc., depending on the language )
  that receive a list of integers as input, and return the largest and lowest number in that list, respectively.
  Examples (Input -> Output)
  * [4,6,2,1,9,63,-134,566]         -> max = 566, min = -134
  * [-52, 56, 30, 29, -54, 0, -110] -> min = -110, max = 56
  * [42, 54, 65, 87, 0]             -> min = 0, max = 87
  * [5]                             -> min = 5, max = 5
  Notes
  You may consider that there will not be any empty arrays/vectors.

/*Smallest value of an array
  Write a function that can return the smallest value of an array or the index of that value.
  The function's 2nd parameter will tell whether it should return the value or the index.
  Assume the first parameter will always be an array filled with at least 1 number and no duplicates.
  Assume the second parameter will be a string holding one of two values: 'value' and 'index'.
  min([1,2,3,4,5], 'value') // => 1
  min([1,2,3,4,5], 'index') // => 0

/*What's the real floor?
  Americans are odd people: in their buildings, the first floor is actually the ground floor and there is no 13th floor (due to superstition).
  Write a function that given a floor in the american system returns the floor in the european system.
  With the 1st floor being replaced by the ground floor and the 13th floor being removed, the numbers move down to take their place. In case of above 13, they move down by two because there are two omitted numbers below them.
  Basements (negatives) stay the same as the universal level.

  1  =>  0 
  0  =>  0
  5  =>  4
  15  =>  13
  -3  =>  -3

  Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y.
  All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.
  Examples:

  3) n = 100, x = 5, y = 3 => false because 100 is not divisible by 3
  4) n =  12, x = 7, y = 5 => false because  12 is neither divisible by 7 nor 5
